<h1>Semantic UI and Ruby on Rails</h1>
<div>
<h2>Semantic UI</h2>
<img src="https://react.semantic-ui.com/logo.png" alt="Semantic UI">
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Semantic UI is a development framework used for creating simple and attractive web applications. 
    It is often seen as a minimalist alternative to bootstrap making it a less well known, yet still effective framework. 
    It is not a very popular framework in general with only 1400 followers on GitHub. 
    It has a robust, well documented grid system which is very similar to Bootstrap. 
    Its simplicity and aesthetics make it very easy to learn and as such makes it a good option for beginners looking to create web applications. 
    This simplicity comes at a cost however as Semantic UI does lack the amenities of a framework such as Bootstrap. 
    It has less browser compatibility, a less reponsive design which can be an issue when developing mobile applications, 
    and a much smaller community making it more difficult to share and acquire knowledge about the framework. 
    Web Devlopers looking to create simple websites focusing primarily on aesthetic would enjoy using Semantic UI. 
    Anything more complicated however and they would be better off using a more thorough framework such as Angular.</p>

<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4223" alt="RoR">
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Ruby on Rails is an open source web development application written in the Ruby programming language. 
    It is very popular, with many well known applications such as GitHub, Shopify, and Twitch being made using Ruby on Rails. 
    This can be attributed to its reputation as a simple and effective tool, as well as its ease of access due to it being free. 
    Ruby on Rails is a backend web development framework and is a very simple languge to learn with much of its syntax being English
    keywords. Some more features are good documentation, good compatability with front-end frameworks, and a high development speed.
    Some downsides to using Ruby are a slow runtime speed, and a lack of flexibility when dealing with the development of apps with 
    very specific functionalities. For regular web applications however, Ruby on Rails is considered a perfect solution.</p>
