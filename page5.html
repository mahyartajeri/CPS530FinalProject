        <h2>Semantic UI</h2>
        <div style="font-size: 1.75vw;">
            Semantic UI is a very intuitve front-end framework that can design simple
            yet effective webpages that are easy on the eyes. Semantic UI has Boostrap-like 
            qualities that allow developers to create sites that work on computer, tablet and 
            mobile screens. It also has design features like the "Card" used on page 4
            that formats a group of information neatly. Our experience with Semantic UI
            is very positive overall as it has an easy learning curve and can be used on
            any html page with just one &lt;script&gt; tag. Comapared to regular CSS and 
            HTML, Semantic UI fits right in just by using some identfiers in the class of
            HTML elements and is very simple to implement.

        <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
        <div style="font-size: 1.75vw;">
            Ruby on Rails is a back-end framework that manages your server-side tasks 
            efficiently, and allows for imbedded Ruby code in your HTML files. Learning 
            how to use ruby on rails has a steep learning curve, compared to something as 
            simple as in-line php. There are a lot of different aspects of Ruby on Rails
            such as model control view architecture, the different folders required to run
            the framework, and a general knowledge of regular Ruby. Ruby on Rails also has
            some configuration regarding the Ruby language to run on your system, which is 
            an added level of difficulty. Overall, though, Ruby on Rails proved to be 
            a very useful backend framework as it organized the server-side compononents 
            neatly and simplified the rest of the project.

        <h2>In Retrospect</h2>
        <div style="font-size: 1.75vw;">
            Do we regret choosing Semantic UI and Ruby on Rails? No. Are we going
            to use Semantic UI and Ruby on Rails again? Maybe. Semantic UI is a very
            useful framework that is simple to implement, so using Semantic in the future
            sounds like a no-brainer. Ruby on Rails becomes much easier to use after setting
            it up the first time, but at the same time we aren't the most comfortable with 
            the language of Ruby itself, which is an integral part of Ruby on Rails. We have
            studied languages like Python further in detail, so going out of our way to use 
            Ruby on Rails can be a cause for headache.
